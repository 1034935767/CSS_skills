			There was once a farmer who had a fine olive orchard. He was very hardworking, 
			and the farm always prospered under his care. But he knew that his three sons 
			despised the farm work, and were eager to make wealth, trough adventure.

			And when they saw how much money had come from the orchard, they suddenly understood 
			what the wise father had meant when he said, "There is gold hidden in the orchard. 
			Dig for it, if you wish it."
